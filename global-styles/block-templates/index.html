<h1>Welcome to the Gutenberg Editor</h1>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The goal of this new editor is to make adding rich content to WordPress simple and enjoyable. This whole post is
	composed of <em>pieces of content</em>‚Äîsomewhat similar to LEGO bricks‚Äîthat you can move around and interact with.
	Move your cursor around and you‚Äôll notice the different blocks light up with outlines and arrows. Press the arrows
	to reposition blocks quickly, without fearing about losing things in the process of copying and pasting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What you are reading now is a <strong>text block</strong> the most basic block of all. The text block has its own
	controls to be moved freely around the post...</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"right"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-right">... like this one, which is right aligned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Headings are separate blocks as well, which helps with the outline and organization of your content.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>A Picture is Worth a Thousand Words</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Handling images and media with the utmost care is a primary focus of the new editor. Hopefully, you‚Äôll find aspects
	of adding captions or going full-width with your pictures much easier and robust than before.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image">
	<figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://cldup.com/cXyG__fTLN.jpg" alt="Beautiful landscape" />
		<figcaption>If your theme supports it, you‚Äôll see the "wide" button on the image toolbar. Give it a try.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>
</div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Try selecting and removing or editing the caption, now you don‚Äôt have to be careful about selecting the image or
	other text by mistake and ruining the presentation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>The <em>Inserter</em> Tool</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagine everything that WordPress can do is available to you quickly and in the same place on the interface. No need
	to figure out HTML tags, classes, or remember complicated shortcode syntax. That‚Äôs the spirit behind the
	inserter‚Äîthe <code>(+)</code> button you‚Äôll see around the editor‚Äîwhich allows you to browse all available content
	blocks and add them into your post. Plugins and themes are able to register their own, opening up all sort of
	possibilities for rich editing and publishing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Go give it a try, you may discover things WordPress can already add into your posts that you didn‚Äôt know about.
	Here‚Äôs a short list of what you can currently find there:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul>
	<li>Text &amp; Headings</li>
	<li>Images &amp; Videos</li>
	<li>Galleries</li>
	<li>Embeds, like YouTube, Tweets, or other WordPress posts.</li>
	<li>Layout blocks, like Buttons, Hero Images, Separators, etc.</li>
	<li>And <em>Lists</em> like this one of course :)</li>
</ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<h2>Visual Editing</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A huge benefit of blocks is that you can edit them in place and manipulate your content directly. Instead of having
	fields for editing things like the source of a quote, or the text of a button, you can directly change the content.
	Try editing the following quote:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
	<p>The editor will endeavor to create a new page and post building experience that makes writing rich posts
		effortless, and has ‚Äúblocks‚Äù to make it easy what today might take shortcodes, custom HTML, or ‚Äúmystery meat‚Äù
		embed discovery.</p><cite>Matt Mullenweg, 2017</cite>
</blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The information corresponding to the source of the quote is a separate text field, similar to captions under images,
	so the structure of the quote is protected even if you select, modify, or remove the source. It‚Äôs always easy to add
	it back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Blocks can be anything you need. For instance, you may want to add a subdued quote as part of the composition of your
	text, or you may prefer to display a giant stylized one. All of these options are available in the inserter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[null,null,null],"columns":2} -->
<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped">
	<ul class="blocks-gallery-grid">
		<li class="blocks-gallery-item">
			<figure><img src="https://cldup.com/n0g6ME5VKC.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
		</li>
		<li class="blocks-gallery-item">
			<figure><img src="https://cldup.com/ZjESfxPI3R.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
		</li>
		<li class="blocks-gallery-item">
			<figure><img src="https://cldup.com/EKNF8xD2UM.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
		</li>
	</ul>
</figure>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can change the amount of columns in your galleries by dragging a slider in the block inspector in the sidebar.
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2>Media Rich</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you combine the new <strong>wide</strong> and <strong>full-wide</strong> alignments with galleries, you can create
	a very media rich layout, very quickly:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"full"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull"><img src="https://cldup.com/8lhI-gKnI2.jpg"
		alt="Accessibility is important ‚Äî don‚Äôt forget image alt attribute" /></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sure, the full-wide image can be pretty big. But sometimes the image is worth it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:gallery {"ids":[null,null],"align":"wide"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-gallery alignwide columns-2 is-cropped">
	<ul class="blocks-gallery-grid">
		<li class="blocks-gallery-item">
			<figure><img src="https://cldup.com/_rSwtEeDGD.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
		</li>
		<li class="blocks-gallery-item">
			<figure><img src="https://cldup.com/L-cC3qX2DN.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
		</li>
	</ul>
</figure>
<!-- /wp:gallery -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The above is a gallery with just two images. It‚Äôs an easier way to create visually appealing layouts, without having
	to deal with floats. You can also easily convert the gallery back to individual images again, by using the block
	switcher.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Any block can opt into these alignments. The embed block has them also, and is responsive out of the box:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:core-embed/vimeo {"url":"https://vimeo.com/22439234","type":"video","providerNameSlug":"vimeo","align":"wide","className":"wp-has-aspect-ratio wp-embed-aspect-16-9"} -->
<figure
	class="wp-block-embed-vimeo alignwide wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-has-aspect-ratio wp-embed-aspect-16-9">
	<div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
		https://vimeo.com/22439234
	</div>
</figure>
<!-- /wp:core-embed/vimeo -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can build any block you like, static or dynamic, decorative or plain. Here‚Äôs a pullquote block:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:pullquote -->
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote">
	<blockquote>
		<p>Code is Poetry</p><cite>The WordPress community</cite>
	</blockquote>
</figure>
<!-- /wp:pullquote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center">

<!-- wp:button {"align":"center"} -->
