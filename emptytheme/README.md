# Empty Theme

Empty theme contains all of the boilerplate you need to get started building a block-based theme: 

- An empty `theme.json` file. 
- `functions.php` with some basic setup.
- `style.css` to set up the theme.
- A separate stylesheet with all the front-end alignments you'll need. 
- An empty `index.php`

It also includes a basic `index.html` template and `header.html` template part so that the theme works out of the box with no modifications. 

For more background on the theme, [read the original PR](https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments/pull/81).
